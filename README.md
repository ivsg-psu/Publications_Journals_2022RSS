<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

Vehicles are highly likely to lose control unexpectedly when encountering unforeseen hazardous road friction conditions. With automation and connectivity increasingly available to assist drivers, vehicle performance can significantly benefit from a road friction preview map, particularly to identify where and how friction ahead of a vehicle may be suddenly decreasing. Although many techniques enable the vehicle to measure the local friction as driving upon a surface, these encounters limit the ability of a vehicle to slow down before a low-friction surface is already encountered. Using the connectivity of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a global road friction map can be created by aggregating information from vehicles. A challenge in the creation of these global friction maps is the very large quantity of data involved, and that the measurements populating the map are generated by vehicle trajectories that do not uniformly cover the grid. 
This paper presents a road friction map generation strategy that aggregates the measured road-tire friction coefficients along the individual trajectories of CAVs into a road surface grid. And through clustering the friction grids further, an insight of this work is that the friction map can be represented compactly by rectangular boxes defined by a pair of corner coordinates in space, a friction value, and a confidence interval within the box. To demonstrate the method, a simulation is presented that integrates traffic simulations, vehicle dynamics and on-vehicle friction estimators, and a highway road surface where friction is changing in space, particularly over a bridge segment. The experimental results indicate that the road friction distribution can be measured effectively by collecting and aggregating the friction data from CAVs.
