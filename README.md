<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

Vehicles are highly likely to lose control unexpectedly when encountering unforeseen hazardous road friction conditions. With automation and connectivity increasingly available to assist drivers, vehicle performance can significantly benefit from a road friction preview map, particularly to identify where and how friction ahead of a vehicle may be suddenly decreasing. Although many techniques enable the vehicle to measure the local friction as driving upon a surface, these encounters limit the ability of a vehicle to slow down before a low-friction surface is already encountered. Using the connectivity of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a global road friction map can be created by aggregating information from vehicles. A challenge in the creation of these global friction maps is the very large quantity of data involved, and that the measurements populating the map are generated by vehicle trajectories that do not uniformly cover the grid. 
This paper presents a road friction map generation strategy that aggregates the measured road-tire friction coefficients along the individual trajectories of CAVs into a road surface grid. And through clustering the friction grids further, an insight of this work is that the friction map can be represented compactly by rectangular boxes defined by a pair of corner coordinates in space, a friction value, and a confidence interval within the box. To demonstrate the method, a simulation is presented that integrates traffic simulations, vehicle dynamics and on-vehicle friction estimators, and a highway road surface where friction is changing in space, particularly over a bridge segment. The experimental results indicate that the road friction distribution can be measured effectively by collecting and aggregating the friction data from CAVs.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1.  Make sure to run MATLAB 2020b or higher. Why? The "digitspattern" command used in the DebugTools was released late 2020 and this is used heavily in the Debug routines. If debugging is shut off, then earlier MATLAB versions will likely work.

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ivsg-psu/FeatureExtraction_DataClean_BreakDataIntoLaps
   ```
3. Unzip the zip files (DebugTools and PathClassLibrary) into a Utilities folder (.\Utilities), in locations .\Utilities\DebugTools and .\Utilities\PathClassLibrary
4. Confirm it works! Run script_demo_Laps from the root directory root location. If the code works, the script should run without errors. This script produces numerous example images such as those in this README file.


<!-- STRUCTURE OF THE REPO -->
### Directories
The following are the top level directories within the repository:
<ul>
	<li>/Documents folder: Descriptions of the functionality and usage of the various MATLAB functions and scripts in the repository.</li>
	<li>/Functions folder: The majority of the code for the point and patch association functionalities are implemented in this directory. All functions as well as test scripts are provided.</li>
	<li>/Utilities folder: Dependencies that are utilized but not implemented in this repository are placed in the Utilities directory. These can be single files but are most often folders containing other cloned repositories.</li>
</ul>

### Dependencies

* [Errata_Tutorials_DebugTools](https://github.com/ivsg-psu/Errata_Tutorials_DebugTools) - The DebugTools repo is used for the initial automated folder setup, and for input checking and general debugging calls within subfunctions. The repo can be found at: https://github.com/ivsg-psu/Errata_Tutorials_DebugTools

* [PathPlanning_PathTools_PathClassLibrary](https://github.com/ivsg-psu/PathPlanning_PathTools_PathClassLibrary) - the PathClassLibrary contains tools used to find intersections of the data with particular line segments, which is used to find start/end/excursion locations in the functions. The repo can be found at: https://github.com/ivsg-psu/PathPlanning_PathTools_PathClassLibrary

    Each should be installed in a folder called "Utilities" under the root folder, namely ./Utilities/DebugTools/ , ./Utilities/PathClassLibrary/ . If you wish to put these codes in different directories, the main call stack in script_demo_Laps can be easily modified with strings specifying the different location, but the user will have to make these edits directly. 
    
    For ease of getting started, the zip files of the directories used - without the .git repo information, to keep them small - are included in this repo.

<!-- FUNCTION DEFINITIONS -->
### Functions
**Basic Support Functions**
<ul>
	<li>
    fcn_Laps_plotLapsXY.m : This function plots the laps. For example, the function was used to make the plot below of the last Sample laps.
    <br>
    <img src=".\Images\fcn_Laps_plotLapsXY.png" alt="fcn_Laps_plotLapsXY picture" width="400" height="300">
    </li>
	<li>
    fcn_Laps_fillSampleLaps.m : This function allows users to create dummy data to test lap functions. The test laps are in general difficult situations, including scenarios where laps loop back onto themself and/or with separate looping structures. These challenges show that the library can work on varying and complicated data sets. NOTE: within this function, commented out typically, there is code to allow users to draw their own lap test cases.
    <br>
    <img src=".\Images\fcn_Laps_fillSampleLaps.png" alt="fcn_Laps_fillSampleLaps picture" width="400" height="300">
    </li>
    <li>
    fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition.m : Plots any type of zone, allowing user-defined colors. For example, the figure below shows a radial zone for the start, and a line segment for the end. For the line segment, an arrow is given that indicates which direction the segment must be crossed in order for the condition to be counted. 
    <br>
    <img src=".\Images\fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition.png" alt="fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition picture" width="400" height="300">
    </li>
    <li>
    fcn_Laps_plotPointZoneDefinition.m : Plots a point zone, allowing user-defined colors. This function is mostly used to support fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition.m 
    </li>
    <li>
    fcn_Laps_plotSegmentZoneDefinition.m : Plots a segment zone, allowing user-defined colors. This function is mostly used to support fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition.m 
    </li>
    
    

</ul>

**Core Functions**
<ul>
	<li>
    fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLaps.m : This is the core function for this repo that breaks data into laps. Note: the example shown below uses radial zone definitions, and the results illustrate how a lap, when it is within a start zone, starts at the FIRST point within a start zone. Similarly, each lap ends at the LAST point before exiting the end zone definition. The input data is a traversal type for this particular function.
    <br>
    <img src=".\Images\fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLaps.png" alt="fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLaps picture" width="400" height="300">
    </li>	
	<li>
    fcn_Laps_checkZoneType.m : This function supports fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLaps by checking if the zone definition inputs are either a point or line segment zone specification.
    </li>
	<li>
    fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLapIndices.m : This is a more advanced version of fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLaps, where the outputs are the indices that apply to each lap. The input type is also easier to use, a "path" type which is just an array of [X Y]. The example here shows the use of a segment type zone for the start zone, a point-radius type zone for the end zone. The results of this function are the row indices of the data. The plot below illustrates that the function returns 3 laps in this example, and as well returns the pre-lap and post-lap data. One can observe that it is common that the prelap data for one lap (Lap 2) consists of the post-lap data for the prior lap (Lap 1).

    <img src=".\Images\fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLapIndices.png" alt="fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLapIndices picture" width="600" height="300">
    </li>	
	<li>
    fcn_Laps_findSegmentZoneStartStop.m : A supporting function that finds the portions of a path that meet a segment zone criteria, returning the starting/ending indices for every crossing of a segment zone. The crossing must cross in the correct direction, and a segment is considered crossed if either the start or end of segment lie on the segment line. This is illustrated in the challenging example shown below, where the input path (thin blue) starts at the top, and then zig-zags repeatedly over a segment definition (green). For each time the blue line crosses the line segment, that portion of the path is saved as a separate possible crossing and thus, for this example, there are 5 possible crossings.
    <br>
    <img src=".\Images\fcn_Laps_findSegmentZoneStartStop.png" alt="fcn_Laps_findSegmentZoneStartStop picture" width="400" height="300">
    </li>	
	<li>
    fcn_Laps_findPointZoneStartStopAndMinimum.m : A supporting function that finds the portions of a path that meet a point zone criteria, returning the starting/ending indices for every crossing of a point zone. Note that a minimum number of points must be within the zone for it to be considered activated, which is useful for real-world data (such as GPS recordings) where noise may randomly push one point of a path randomly into a zone, and then jump out. This number of points threshold can be user-defined. In the example below, the threshold is 4 points and one can see that, for a path that crosses over the zone three times, that two of the crossings are found to meet the 4-point criteria.
    <br>
    <img src=".\Images\fcn_Laps_findPointZoneStartStopAndMinimum.png" alt="fcn_Laps_findPointZoneStartStopAndMinimum picture" width="400" height="300">
    </li>	
</ul>
Each of the functions has an associated test script, using the convention

```sh
script_test_fcn_fcnname
```
where fcnname is the function name as listed above.

As well, each of the functions includes a well-documented header that explains inputs and outputs. These are supported by MATLAB's help style so that one can type:

```sh
help fcn_fcnname
```
for any function to view function details.

### Examples

1. Run the main script to set up the workspace and demonstrate main outputs, including the figures included here:

   ```sh
   script_demo_Laps
   ```
    This exercises the main function of this code: fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLaps

2. After running the main script to define the included directories for utility functions, one can then navigate to the Functions directory and run any of the functions or scripts there as well. All functions for this library are found in the Functions sub-folder, and each has an associated test script. Run any of the various test scripts, such as:

   ```sh
   script_test_fcn_Laps_breakDataIntoLapIndices
   ```
